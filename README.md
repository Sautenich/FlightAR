The swift advancement of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) technologies necessitates new standards for developing human-drone interaction (HDI) interfaces. Most interfaces for HDI, especially first-person view (FPV) goggles, limit the robot operator’s ability to obtain information from the environment.
This paper presents a novel interface, FlightAR, that integrates augmented reality (AR) overlays of UAV first-person view (FPV) and bottom camera feeds with head-mounted display (HMD) to enhance the pilot’s situational awareness. Using FlightAR, the system provides pilots not only with a video stream from several UAV cameras simultaneously, but also the ability to observe their surroundings in real time. User evaluation with NASATLX and UEQ surveys showed low physical demand (µ = 1.8, SD = 0.8) and good performance (µ = 3.4, SD = 0.8), proving better user assessments in comparison with baseline FPV goggles. Participants also rated the system highly for stimulation (µ = 2.35, SD = 0.9), novelty (µ = 2.1, SD = 0.9) and attractiveness (µ = 1.97, SD = 1), indicating positive user experiences. These results demonstrate the potential of the system to improve UAV piloting experience through enhanced situational awareness and intuitive control.
